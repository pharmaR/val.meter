\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{data}}{A mutable environment, used to aggregate package meatadata.
When working with a \code{\link{pkg}} object, you may prefer to use the \code{[[} and
\code{$} operators for accessing data in this environment, which will also
prompt any necessary data dependencies to be evaluated.}

\item{\code{metrics}}{Return calculated listing of all metrics}

\item{\code{resource}}{A \code{\link{resource}} (often a \code{\link{multi_resource}}), providing
the resources to be used for deriving packages data. If a
\code{\link{multi_resource}}, the order of resources determines the precedence
of information. If information about a package could be derived from
multiple sources, the first source is prioritized.}

\item{\code{scopes}}{Permissible scopes for deriving data.}
}}
