\title{Source Control Metrics}
\description{
Metrics for assessing whether a package has source code on a recognized
hosting platform based on an allow-list of known domains.
}
\section{Metrics}{


\describe{
\item{\code{recognized_source_url}}{The inferred URL of the package's source
control repository, extracted from the URL and BugReports fields in the
DESCRIPTION file and matched against an allow-list of recognized domains.}
\item{\code{has_recognized_source}}{A logical indicating whether the package has
a source code repository on a recognized hosting platform from the
allow-list.}
}
}

\section{Allow-List Approach}{


These metrics use an allow-list of recognized source control hosting domains
to identify source repositories. This means:
\itemize{
\item Only URLs matching domains in the allow-list are recognized
\item Packages may have source control not detected if hosted elsewhere
\item The allow-list is customizable to include additional domains
\item Results indicate recognized hosting, not definitive source control presence
}
}

\section{Customization}{


The recognized domains can be customized. For details on the default
recognized domains and how to customize them, see \code{\link{options}}.

This is useful for:
\itemize{
\item Adding self-hosted GitLab, Gitea, or Forgejo instances
\item Including internal enterprise git hosting services
\item Supporting additional federated git providers
}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Check if a package has source on a recognized platform
p <- pkg("ggplot2")
p$has_recognized_source  # TRUE
p$recognized_source_url  # "https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2"

# Customize to add self-hosted GitLab to the allow-list
# Save the original value to restore later
old_domains <- opt_set("source_control_domains", c(
  "github.com",
  "gitlab.com",
  "git.mycompany.com"
))

# Or extend the defaults
default_domains <- opt("source_control_domains")
old_domains <- opt_set("source_control_domains", c(
  default_domains,
  "git.mycompany.com",
  "forge.myorg.net"
))

# Restore original value
opt_set("source_control_domains", old_domains)
}
